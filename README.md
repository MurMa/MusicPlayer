# MusicPlayer - v18.0 #

This is a Music Player, including a live audio visualizer.

The project is written in Java, strongly using the [processing](https://processing.org) framework.

## Info ##

This project is a work in progress!
The code is a total mess without any documentation, I am sorry for that.
Therefor there will probably be a million bugs. You can try to fix some yourself if you find them. 

## How to start ##
There are executables for Windows and Linux in the application folders, which can be used to launch the program.

If you want build the project yourself, i recommend the processing IDE.

## Instructions ## 

### Configuration ###

After starting the project, you need to configure your songs directory. To do this, go to the Songs Tab and click the button on the top left. You will be prompted to set your directory.

After setting your directory, the songs will be loaded in.

### Style ###
You can change the style of the app in the settings and also add a background wallpaper.

### Visualizer ###
If you play a song through the player, you can simply click the Visualizer Tab to see it. Make sure that the checkbox "Live Mode" under settings is turned `OFF`. 

In the Visualizer you can find additional settings by moving your mouse to the top of the monitor.

If you want to use the Visualizer while streaming music or playing it through a different program on your PC, some additional configuration is needed. You need to turn the checkbox "Live Mode" (under settings) to `ON`. Additionally, audio loopback through the operating system is needed.

For Windows:

Go to the Windows sound control panel (Settings -> System -> Sound -> Sound control panel), then go to the recording devices. You should see a device called "Stereomix". Set it as a default device by right clicking it and selecting "Set as default device".
